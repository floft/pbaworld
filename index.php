<p>Once again another year has passed and the time has rolled around for you to start studying for that series of events that happen every year: Pathfinder Bible Achievement! Have you started studying the book of Mark <!--(or Acts and 1 &amp; 2 Thes.), site isn't currently used... so no point in making it look a bit more odd -->? I hope so! Just like the last five years, we have decided to share our pool of questions to help you study for this big event. We hope it helps you study well and do your best no matter what levels you complete.</p>

<p><b>Pathfinder Bible Experience</b><br />
You can study questions from both PBA and PBE, but for the fill-in-the-blank questions, it is mostly only for PBA since a max of 1000 verses can be displayed.</p>

<p><b>The new site</b><br />
If you notice any problems, please send me a <i>detailed</i> email on the contact page. If you can't login, you will need to reset your password since I moved away from Drupal to increase the security of the user page. Although passwords are still not sent over HTTPS, they are SHA256 hashed on your computer and then sent to PBA World's server (meaning nobody without a quantum computer can figure out your password). Now you can feel safer. =)</p>
