PBA World
========

I created a website to help people study for Pathfinder Bible Achievement
five or so years ago and have been recreating it almost every year since.
Since now people are moving to Pathfinder Bible Experience, here is the
code I have been using for the site. See *schema.sql* for the database
structure. As for the license, it's under the
[ISC license](http://floft.net/uploads/isc-license.txt). Feel free to use
it and improve it.

Look at *pba_questions.sql* for an archive of the database right before this
website was shut down.
